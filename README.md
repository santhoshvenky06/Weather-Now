# Weather-Now
The Vue Weather App is a dynamic and user-friendly web application that provides real-time weather information and forecasts for locations worldwide. Built with Vue.js on the frontend and Express.js on the backend, this project leverages the power of modern web technologies to deliver accurate weather data. Features include:

Current Weather: Get instant access to the latest weather conditions, including temperature, "feels like" temperature, and a brief weather description.

5-Day Forecast: Plan ahead with a 5-day weather forecast, offering detailed insights into temperature, wind speed, and rainfall.

Text-to-Speech Accessibility: Our app is designed to be accessible to all users. The text-to-speech functionality allows weather information to be read aloud, catering to individuals with visual impairments and those who prefer auditory information.

Responsive Design: Enjoy a seamless user experience on various devices, thanks to our responsive design, crafted using the Bulma CSS framework.

Secure Data Retrieval: We source weather data from the reliable OpenWeatherMap API and ensure secure data retrieval with CORS-enabled communication.

This GitHub repository hosts the complete source code for the Vue Weather App, along with detailed documentation to help you understand the codebase and set up your own instance. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this project as a foundation for your weather-related web applications.
